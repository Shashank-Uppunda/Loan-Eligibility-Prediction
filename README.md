This project uses Logistic Regression to predict loan eligibility based on factors like income, credit score, and employment status. It includes data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling numerical features. Error handling is incorporated using try-except blocks to ensure smooth execution during data processing and model prediction, preventing disruptions from potential issues.
